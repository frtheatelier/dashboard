## BRIEF DESCRIPTION
Personal project I've been making for about 2 months by now (with a lot of breaks in between). Didn't think to publish it here as a static site before...

## POSSIBLE ENHANCEMENTS
- Integrating MySQL to ease up changing project images. (might have to change hosts though)
- Adding a 'Commissions' window
- Optimising views for different screen sizes
